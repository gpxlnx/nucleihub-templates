  description: |
    This template detects if the Android application is marked as debuggable. Applications with `android:debuggable="true"` are susceptible to reverse engineering and runtime modifications, increasing the risk of exploitation.
  remediation: |
    Remove the `android:debuggable="true"` attribute from the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, or ensure it is set to `false` in production builds to prevent unauthorized debugging access.
