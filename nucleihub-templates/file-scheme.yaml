  description: |
    This template detects the use of the `file` scheme in Android applications. The `file` scheme can be used to access local files and interact with other apps or components. However, using the `file` scheme can expose sensitive files to unauthorized access or introduce path traversal vulnerabilities. It is recommended to avoid using the `file` scheme in production apps and use content URIs instead.
  remediation: |
    Replace the use of `file` scheme with content URIs (`content://`) to prevent unauthorized access to local files and avoid path traversal vulnerabilities. Always validate and sanitize file paths to ensure they do not expose sensitive resources or allow unintended access.
