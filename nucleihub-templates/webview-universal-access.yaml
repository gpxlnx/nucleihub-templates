  name: Webview Universal Access Enabled

  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects if `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is enabled in WebView. Enabling this setting allows content from `file://` URLs to access content from any origin, which can be exploited to read local files or inject malicious content.
  remediation: |
    Avoid enabling `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` unless absolutely necessary. Use stricter security settings in WebView and validate the content that is being accessed to prevent unauthorized file access or code execution.
